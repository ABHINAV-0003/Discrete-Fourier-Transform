DFTLib - Discrete Signals Python Library

This library provides function for direct calculations on Discrete sequences. Functions are documented below:  

Functions:

wp(N) : This function returns the Twiddle factor whose value is exp(j (2*pi)/ N)

cwp(N): This function returns the conjugate of Twiddle factor whose value is exp(-j (2*pi)/ N)

power(complexno,P) : This function returns the power of complex number raised to P. (Complexno)^P

TM(N,st) :  This function displays the Twiddle Matrix for N bit sequence. 
	    st is a string which can take 2 values : 
	    "TM" - for Normal Twiddle Matrix 
	    "CTM"- For conjugate Twiddle Matrix

DFT(seq) : This function returns Discrete Fourier Transform of a N bit sequence.

IDFT(seq) : This function returns Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform of a N bit sequence.

lcrotate(seq,n) : This function returns the left circularly rotated seq by n bits.

rcrotate(seq,n) : This function returns the right circularly rotated seq by n bits.

circonv(seq1,seq2): This function returns the circular convolution of two discrete sequences.

linconv(seq1,seq2): This function returns the linear convolution of two discrete sequences.

osconv(seq1,seq2): This function returns the step by step explained overlap save convolution of two discrete sequences.

asconv(seq1,seq2): This function returns the step by step explained overlap add convolution of two discrete sequences.
