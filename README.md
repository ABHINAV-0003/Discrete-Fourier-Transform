# Discrete-Fourier-Transform
## **Python script for calculating DFT of N bit finite sequence.**

This script will help you to calculate Discrete Fourier Transform of N bit finite Sequence .

You have to enter N - Number of bits in sequence
Enter the sequence of N bits seperated by commas ','. (Assumed : First element is at origin.)

Script will generate Twiddle Matrix and DFT for input N bit sequence.

# DFTLib - Discrete Functions and Transforms - Python Library

This Repository also includes DFTlib that has all the basic functions which are generally performed on Discrete Sequences. 
Download the Library. Import it in your project to access any function of the library in your project.

### **Requirements:**
1. Python 3.0 or more
2. Sympy, panda and cmath libraries installed.
